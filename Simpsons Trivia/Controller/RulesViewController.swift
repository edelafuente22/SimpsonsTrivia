        let string = "How do I play this game? \nEach game consists of 12 questions, with each question carrying a 15-second time limit. Answer as many as you can to test your knowledge of \"The Simpsons\"! \n\nHow does scoring work? \nScore points based on whether you guess each question correctly and how quickly you submit your guess. \n\nDo I need to sign in to Game Center to play? \nNo, signing in to Game Center is optional. However, you can use it to track your high scores and how well you score against other players. \n\nWhy do I see some of the same questions over and over? \nThe game contains more than 300 questions, and we are adding new questions with every update. You will likely see repeat questions the more you play, but if you play multiple games in one session, questions will not repeat. \n\nAre you affiliated with \"The Simpsons\"? \nNo. \"The Simpsons\" is a registered trademark of 20th Century Fox. \n\nWhy did you make this game? \nBecause we're hardcore Simpsons fans, much like the users we hope will be playing this game. Inspired by \"Simpsons\" trivia nights and online groups, we wanted to create something fans can use to pass the time while beefing up their knowledge of the show. \n\nWhere did you get the images from? \nAll images and GIFs were generated through Frinkiac. \n\nDo questions cover the entire history of \"The Simpsons\"? \nMost questions draw from Seasons 1 through 18, but general knowledge questions take into account the series' entire history. \n\nI think I see an error in one of the questions. How do I report it?\nDrop us a line via email to report errors and give feedback. \n\nCan I suggest some questions to include in the game? \nSure! Use the same email link above to send us your ideas." as NSString
