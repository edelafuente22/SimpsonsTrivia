Answer as many as you can to test your knowledge of \"The Simpsons\"! \n\nWill I get the same questions in every game? \nThe game contains more than 300 questions, and we are adding new questions with every update. However, you will likely see repeat questions the more you play. \n\nAre you affiliated with \"The Simpsons\"? \nNo. \"The Simpsons\" is a registered trademark of 20th Century Fox. \n\nWhy did you make this game? \nBecause we're hardcore Simpsons fans, much like the users we hope will be playing this game. Inspired by \"Simpsons\" trivia nights and online groups, we wanted to create something fans can use to pass the time while beefing up their knowledge of the show. \n\nWhere did you get the images from? \nAll images and GIFs were generated through Frinkiac. \n\nDo questions cover the entire history of \"The Simpsons\"? \nCurrently, questions draw from Seasons 1 through 17. \n\nI think I see an error in one of the questions. How do I report it?\nDrop us a line via email to report errors and give feedback. \n\nCan I suggest some questions to include in the game? \nSure! Use the same email link above to send us your ideas." as NSString
